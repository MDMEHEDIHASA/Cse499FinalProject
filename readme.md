This project is called Event detection. Suppose there are some violence occurs in video then my model can tell me there are some

violence involvement in this video. If there is an event of wedding then my model can tell me that it is a event of wedding.If any one playing tennis, swimming, singing my model can take this video and in this video 

it can show me the result. You can also see there is a involvement of a meeting and convocation. Like example: It can tell me Involvement in violence, Involvement in swimming,dancing,singing etc.

For this use Resnet50, Vg16, and CNN. And you can go to video classfication Model Rs50 or Video classification Vg16

and goto output video and see the resultant video.

For using this you have to train your dataset with colab for details you can see the newTrainingPart.ipynb then 
test result with videoTestResNet50.ipynb. Because of large file we didn't upload the file but if anyone want can contact with me

You can see the final Result through my channel and the Video link is:
